# Features

PocketMage is a productivity PDA first. The device focuses on reading, editing, quick navigation, and simple workflows that fit E-Ink. This page covers what the current firmware can do and what is planned.

## The design philosophy

The device pairs a slow, sharp E-Ink panel with a fast, small OLED. Anything that benefits from instant feedback - prompts, status, timers - lives on the OLED. Anything that benefits from a large readable page - notes, files, calendars - lives on the E-Ink. The result is a note-taking device that feels responsive without sacrificing E-Ink's power efficiency.

## Hardware behavior

::: callout tip "The screen split matters"
E-Ink handles the main workspace. OLED handles status and fast feedback. The keyboard supports normal, shift, function, and function plus shift layers.
:::

## Sleep and power

On battery, the device enters sleep and shows a random screensaver. When plugged into USB it uses a now-later screen with a clock, upcoming tasks, and weather (work in progress). Waking can go straight into a specific app via the boot shortcut keys, so common flows start with a single keypress.
